1. Wie werde ich MillionÃ¤r, bis ich 60 bin?


https://www.zinsen-berechnen.de/sparrechner.php
900 EUR, 30 years, 7%


2. Formula: make more, spend less and invest the difference {wait & repeat}

Make more
Negotiate your wage better (bank the difference)
Make money on the side
Sell stuff

Spend less
Exercise: calculate your hourly wage
Income: 2,000 EUR net
40h work week x 4,3 weeks per month = 172h per month
2,000 EUR/172h = 11,6 EUR/h
Chanel bag: 1,000 EUR => 86h work (11 work days)
Coffee + cake ?

Money <> time !!

Invest the difference
Low costs
1,058,858 vs. 1,048,269 (1%) vs. 1,037,681 (2%)
-> Passive management
-> buy and hold (long term approach)
Well diversified
3,000 companies in the world vs. Enron
